### Project_1_Bare_Metal_C_Project 
This is the bare-metal C project that was accomplished using the NXP KL25Z microcontroller. A clean and well-structured embedded C code was written by following the coding standard provided by the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Colorado Boulder.

### Project_2_Unit_Tests_Project
The objective of sharing this project is to present the unit test implementation for a program written in embedded C programming language complied using the GCC along with ```-Wall``` and ```-Werror``` flags to consider every warning as an error. It is always recommended to eliminate all possible warnings before program compilation and running a program. And an easy way to achieve this is to always consider warnings as errors by using the ```-Werror``` flag while compilation.

> [!NOTE]
> These projects are just a demonstration of how I write Embedded C programs for development and testing. However, there are other projects where I have developed a more complex code using finite state machines (FSM), APIs, data structures, and algorithms.
